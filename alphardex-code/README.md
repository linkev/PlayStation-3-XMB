# Original Source Code

This directory preserves the original CodePen project by [alphardex](https://codepen.io/alphardex/) that inspired my PlayStation 3 XMB recreation.

I've archived this foundational code with deep appreciation for alphardex's creative work, ensuring it remains accessible and properly credited as the cornerstone of my project.

- index.html is the HTML code.

- css.scss is Sassy Cascading Style Sheets for the styling.

- script.js is the TypeScript code that was created to run the whole wave.

In order to run this, you might need "serve" again, static files don't render. Also, they might not link together as they properly did in the CodePen sandbox, so you might need to hook it up too, sorry!
